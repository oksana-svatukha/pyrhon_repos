I recently completed an engaging project that leverages web APIs to analyze and visualize data from GitHub. The project consists of two main components:

1. Data Collection using GitHub API:
I utilized the GitHub API to query and retrieve information about Python projects hosted on the platform.
This involved making HTTP requests to GitHub's API endpoints, parsing the JSON responses, and extracting relevant data such as repository names, star counts, fork counts, and other metrics that indicate a project's popularity.
3. Data Visualization with Plotly:
After collecting the data, I used Plotly, a powerful data visualization library, to create an interactive visualization.
 This visualization represents the relative popularity of the queried Python projects on GitHub. The interactive nature of the plot allows users to hover over data points, zoom in/out, and potentially filter or sort the data dynamically.

Key features of the project:

* Demonstrates proficiency in working with RESTful APIs
* Showcases data processing and analysis skills
* Highlights the ability to create meaningful and interactive data visualizations
* Combines multiple technologies (Python, GitHub API, Plotly) into a cohesive project

This project not only provided insights into the popularity trends of Python projects on GitHub but also served as an excellent exercise in real-world data collection, processing, and visualization techniques.
 It's a practical example of how APIs can be used to gather valuable data and how modern visualization tools can make that data accessible and understandable.
